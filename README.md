# Web BLE OTA for ESP32

This tool is the Web Bluetooth version of the https://github.com/fbiego/ESP32_BLE_OTA_Arduino solution. The main focus is implementing firmware updates via Web Bluetooth.

The Web Bluetooth API provides the ability to connect and interact with Bluetooth Low Energy peripherals. Youâ€™ll find Web Bluetooth:
- on the desktop (or laptop) in Chrome, Edge and Opera browsers (make sure you have the latest)
- on Android phones in Chrome (perhaps in Edge or Opera?)
- on iOS or iPadOS there is [Bluefy](https://apps.apple.com/hu/app/bluefy-web-ble-browser/id1492822055) that seems to be working.

Safari, Chrome, Edge and Opera on iOS are using the Safari WebKit engine which not yet supports Web Bluetooth. Mobile and desktop Firefox is not implemented it yet, too.

You can try MCU Manager by visiting https://boogie.github.io/esp32-ota-web/ with a supported browser. For security reasons, Web Bluetooth is only working on https addresses or localhost.

## Setting up on your machine

You will need a web server to serve the files. If you have Python, just start `python -m http.server 8000` in the project's root, and you can visit http://localhost:8000/.
